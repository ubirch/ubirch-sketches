/* 
 *  An interrupt example program.
 *  
 *  It sets up an interrupt at X kHz which is used to call the interrupt routing. The interrupt
 *  routing then executes a piece of code while everything else is on hold.
 *  
 *  The max value for the overflow counter (OCR1A) must be less than or equal to 0xFFFF (65535)
 *  The PRESCAL_XX defines account for exactly 1s at the selected prescale (the number by which
 *  the 16MHz signal is divided into).
 *  
 *  Thus if we want to interrupt less than 1s we should use one NONE - 64 or if we want to set 
 *  the interval at longer than 1s use 256 or 1024. However, in case we want to run a routine
 *  only every 5s or longer we need to keep our own counter.
 *  
 *  // PRESCALE values > 0xFFFF
 *  NONE => 1s == ~244 calls
 *  8    => 1s ==  ~30 calls
 *  64   => 1s ==   ~3 calls
 *  
 *  // PRESCALE values < 0xFFFF
 *  256  => 1s ==    1 call (no multiplier possible)
 *  1024 => 1s ==    1 call (up to multiplier 4)
 *  
 *  These numbers help you to calculate your actual interval (most useful if it is below 1s):
 *  Either adjust the number of times the method is called, or in a more practical way, adjust 
 *  the counter value (which is 0xFFFF for NONE - 64) to a lower value that matches your targeted
 *  time interval:
 *  
 *  LOOPS = (FREQUENCY / INTERVAL) / 0xFFFF
 *  
 *  FREQUENCY is 0xF42400 (NONE, 16MHz), 0x1E8480 (8), 0x3D090 (64)
 *  INTERVAL is in seconds and may be 1000 * 125 for 125ms
 *  
 *  For a 1Âµs interval we need no extra loops and can set the OCR1A to 0x10 directly. Just multiply
 *  that number for microsecond intervals.
